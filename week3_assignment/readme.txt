This project is a Portfolio Website Assignment divided into three parts:

Part 1: Created a basic portfolio website using HTML and CSS with Flexbox and Grid layouts. It showcases the banner, profile, education, projects, and skills sections. Screenshots and code are included.

Part 2: Enhanced the portfolio by including images, reorganizing the structure, and refining the design to provide a better user experience.

Part 3: Migrated the portfolio website to React.js, breaking it into reusable components like Banner, Profile, and Projects. Screenshots and React code are included for reference.
